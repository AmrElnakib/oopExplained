Explanation:
--------------
Abstract Class (Animal):
An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with a body).
The sound() method is abstract, meaning subclasses must implement it.

Inheritance:
Classes Dog and Cat extend the Animal class, inheriting its properties and methods.

Method Overriding:
Each subclass (Dog and Cat) provides its own implementation of the sound() method. This is known as method overriding.

Polymorphism:
The Animal type reference is used to refer to Dog and Cat objects. This allows the program to call the appropriate sound() method based on the actual object type.

Concrete Method:
The sleep() method is a concrete method in the Animal class that can be used by all subclasses without modification.

Static Method:
The makeAnimalSound() method demonstrates polymorphism by accepting an Animal reference and calling the sound() method, which resolves to the appropriate implementation at runtime.
This code covers the requested concepts effectively and illustrates how they work together in Java.
